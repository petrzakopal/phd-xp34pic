    abstract = {This paper describes a single unified algorithm for the
                calculation of elementary functions including multiplication,
                division, sin, cos, tan, arctan, sinh, cosh, tanh, arctanh, In,
                exp and square-root. The basis for the algorithm is coordinate
                rotation in a linear, circular, or hyperbolic coordinate system
                depending on which function is to be calculated. The only
                operations required are shifting, adding, subtracting and the
                recall of prestored constants. The limited domain of convergence
                of the algorithm is calculated, leading to a discussion of the
                modifications required to extend the domain for floating point
                calculations.},
